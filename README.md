# prodbg_addons

This repository is a collection of plugins for [ProDBG](https://github.com/emoon/ProDBG). In order to not include all plugins people might want (as it makes the compile of the main ProDBG slower also) this repro is here to have a range of various plugins people may find interesting. Popular ones may also be "promoted" to be included in the main repro.
